##Prompt 2 Analysis

#ChatGPT-generated README:

    The Installation section is more developed and clearer than in Prompt 6.

    Includes many links, though some appear to be placeholders or not functional.

    Overall, the README is too brief and lacks depth.

    Contains placeholders (e.g., []) that require manual completion.

#Deepseek-generated README:

    The Discussion section is concise and reasonably well summarized.

    References are listed with DOIs but lack clickable links or proper citation formatting.

#Copilot-generated README:

Hallucinated Usage
    Contains plenty of placeholders (e.g., []) that require manual completion.

##Prompt 6 Analysis

#ChatGPT-generated README:

    The Project Overview section is well-structured and informative.

    The Results section is overly short and lacks detail.

    Reference links generally work, but some other links are broken or non-functional.

    The Discussion section is clearly written and logically organized.

#Deepseek-generated README:

    Introduces several sections that are left empty or incomplete, requiring manual input.

    Some embedded links are broken or lead nowhere.

    The Results are shared as links rather than being summarized directly in the README.

#Copilot-generated README:

Performed slightly better on results 
Conserved the references in the format
