## 🌟 Overview

**Codefair** is an AI-powered GitHub App that helps you make your research software reusable and compliant with the [FAIR Principles for Research Software](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x). Whether you're building AI/ML models, data visualizations, or statistical analysis tools, Codefair works with your repository to:

- Open issues with actionable suggestions
- Submit pull requests that improve reusability
- Add standardized metadata and licensing
- Help archive your work in repositories like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

You're not just coding — you're building better, FAIRer software.

## ✅ Summary of Improvements

1. **Improved Structure & Headings**:

   * Reorganized content using consistent, semantic section headers (`##`/`###`).
   * Grouped related content (e.g., installation steps, contributing, citation).

2. **Added Standard Sections**:

   * Added a clear **Overview**, **License**, **Citation**, and **Live Status** section.
   * Moved technical detail into a dedicated section for developers.

3. **Clarified Project Purpose**:

   * Made the value proposition upfront and easy to understand with a concise summary.

4. **Fixed Inconsistencies**:

   * Corrected the incorrect LICENSE link (was pointing to AI-READI repo).
   * Ensured consistent tone, formatting, and link presentation.

5. **Improved Readability**:

   * Reformatted blockquotes, note sections, and list items.
   * Used emojis and spacing to enhance visual flow (optional but helpful in many OSS READMEs).
