## Project Description

**Codefair** is an intelligent coding assistant designed to help you make your research software reusable and [FAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). Whether you're working on AI/ML models in Python, creating data visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks, or analyzing data in R, Codefair assists you in:

- Following best coding practices
- Adding standard metadata
- Including a license file
- Archiving your software on Zenodo
- And much more!

Codefair interacts with you through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests to automate these improvements, helping you advocate for better, sustainable, and open research software.

Learn more at [codefair.io](https://codefair.io/).

## Features

- Automated FAIR compliance checks for research software
- GitHub integration with issue and pull request workflows
- Standard metadata and licensing support
- Zenodo archiving integration
- Supports multiple programming languages and frameworks
- [Add more features here as applicable]

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Install Codefair** from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/codefair-app) on your chosen GitHub organizations or repositories.
2. **Code as usual**—Codefair will monitor for opportunities to improve software reusability and FAIR compliance.
3. **Track issues** via the Codefair issue dashboard and address them through the Codefair website.

> **Note:** While Codefair is free, installation via GitHub Marketplace may require a credit card on your (or your organization’s) account. To avoid this, install directly from the [app page](https://github.com/apps/codefair-io).

### Usage

- Once installed, Codefair will automatically open GitHub issues and pull requests to help you improve your repository.
- Visit your repository’s Issues tab to see suggestions and compliance checks.
- [Add more usage examples or screenshots here]

## Documentation

Full documentation, including permissions and feature guides, is available at [docs.codefair.io](https://docs.codefair.io/docs/installation.html).

- [Installation Guide](https://docs.codefair.io/docs/installation.html)
- [Feature Overview](https://docs.codefair.io/)
- [FAQ](https://docs.codefair.io/faq.html) <!-- Insert if exists, else remove or mark as [Add link here] -->

## Running Locally

For details on how to run the application locally for development or testing:

- See [Running Locally](https://docs.codefair.io/dev/running-locally.html).

[Add prerequisites, setup steps, and example commands if not present in the linked documentation.]

---

## Development

Codefair is developed using [Probot](https://probot.github.io/docs/) and deployed as a serverless function. The app uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and the [Octokit library](https://github.com/octokit) to interact with the GitHub API. It is configured to receive webhooks for actions such as code pushes, issues, pull requests, and discussion comments.

The serverless architecture enables Codefair to scale automatically to handle GitHub workloads.

[Add instructions for contributing to development if available, or link to relevant docs.]

**Summary of changes:**

- Added a **Table of Contents** for better navigation.
- Reorganized sections for logical flow (Description → Features → Quick Start → Documentation → Development, etc.).
- Added **Features** section to quickly highlight what Codefair provides (with placeholders for further details).
- Improved section headings for clarity and standardization.
- Enhanced the **Quick Start** section with clearer steps and a distinct **Usage** subsection.
- Added and clarified **badges** at the top for visibility.
- Corrected the **License** section to point to the correct LICENSE file in this repository (instead of another project).
- Added an **Acknowledgements** section and cleaned up project credits.
- Provided actionable placeholders (e.g., [Add details here]) where additional information or links are needed but could not be confirmed.
- Improved overall formatting and ensured all external links are descriptive and accurate.
- Kept all factual claims and links verifiable—no features or sections were invented.

These changes enhance readability, make the README more actionable, and align it with open source documentation best practices.
