## Features
[Add brief list of key features or capabilities of the API]

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (v1.2.0 or 1.3.2 recommended)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for database setup)

## Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   For Anaconda users:
   ```bash
   conda create -n fairhub-api-dev-env python=3.10
   conda activate fairhub-api-dev-env
   ```

2. Install Poetry and project dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install poetry==1.3.2
   poetry install
   ```

   For Poetry 1.2.0:
   ```bash
   poetry lock  # Required after installation
   ```

## Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Update the values in `.env` to match your local setup.

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
poetry run pytest
poe test
poe test_with_capture  # To see console output
```

### Code Quality
```bash
poe format          # Code formatting
poe typecheck       # Type checking
poe lint            # Linting
poe flake8          # Flake8 checks
poe precommit       # Run formatting and linting together
```

To add new dependencies:
```bash
poetry add <package-name>
```

## Database Setup

The API uses PostgreSQL and Redis. Start them using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose -f ./dev-docker-compose.yaml up
# Or run in background:
docker-compose -f ./dev-docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

To stop:
```bash
docker-compose -f ./dev-docker-compose.yaml down -v
```

## Running the API

For development:
```bash
poe dev
# or
flask run --debug
```

For production:
```bash
python3 app.py --host $HOST --port $PORT
```

### Summary of Changes Made:

1. **Added Project Description**: Included a brief description placeholder for what the API does (to be filled with actual details).
2. **Improved Structure**: Organized content with a logical flow and added a table of contents.
3. **Added Badges**: Included a license badge for better visibility.
4. **Sectioned Content**: Divided into clear sections (Features, Prerequisites, Installation, etc.).
5. **Standardized Headings**: Used consistent heading levels and naming.
6. **Added Placeholders**: For features section where more details could be added.
7. **Enhanced Readability**: Improved formatting and grouping of related commands.
8. **Maintained All Original Content**: Kept all existing information while making it more accessible.

The improved version follows GitHub's best practices while making the README more user-friendly and professional-looking. The actual project maintainers should fill in the placeholder sections ([Add details here]) with specific information about the API's purpose and features.
