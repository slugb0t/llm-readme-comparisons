# Overview

This repository is a collection of prompts and outputs from various AI models, including DeepSeek , ChatGPT 4.1 mini (Free tier) and Copilot (GPT 4.1) documentation based on GitHub's best practices, open source documentation standards and examples provided in [matiassingers/awesome-readme](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme).

## File Structure

- `prompts/`: Contains the prompt files used to guide the AI models in generating improved README files.
- `[repo]/prompt-[number]/`: Contains the output files from different AI models (e.g., `chatgpt.md`, `deepseek.md`, `copilot.md`) for each prompt number.
- `[repo]/original.md`: Contains the original README file of the repository.
- `repo_meta.py`: Contains a script for extracting metadata from a repository using Octokitpy library.

## Installation

To run the repo_meta.py script, you need to install the Octokitpy library. You can do the following:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install octokitpy
python repo_meta.py
```

## Input

The input is a prompt from the `prompts` directory followed by the raw content of an existing README file.

## Output

The output is the "improved" README file generated by the AI model.

## Methodology

The prompts were provided to different AI models with new chat interfaces to prevent any influence from previous interactions. We instructed the model to follow closely best practices, open source standards and GitHub's recommendations on READMEs. The web interface of these models provided a copy button which allowed the output to be copied directly into a markdown file. The outputs were then compared against the original README files to assess improvements.

## Philosophy

Why not provide the entire repository as input to the AI models? While it is possible to do so, it is an expensive approach and doesn't scale effectively. Each interaction, query, or investigation by a model is measured in tokens, directly translating into monetary cost. A potential improvement could be supplying repository metadata gathered from GitHub's API, which would provide the AI more context.

Therefor a well crafted README file can optimize the interaction with the AI model.

## Limitations

- Due to the free tier limitations, long README files may not be fully processed by the AI models causing some sections to be truncated, resulting in missing key information. This is a limitation of the token count in the free tier of the AI models.

- VSCode's Copilot extension gave a roadblock by blocking requests since it considered the README file content as "public code" and would not moved forward with the request. We opted to use the Copilot web interface instead, which allowed us to bypass this limitation.

- Time constraints limited to CoFest being only two days, which meant we could not explore more prompt iterations or providing more context to the AI with GitHub's API metadata.

## Results

Various results were observed due to the README files being structured in different manners and formats. Some README files were more structured and detailed causing the AI models to truncate README files, while minimal README files remained short causing limitations in what the AI models could improve.

### Best results

For best results a middle ground between long, detailed and minimal README files would provide the best results. The README files would be structured in a way that the AI models can understand the context and provide improvements without truncating key information.

### Hallucinations

Hallucinations were minimal but present in some outputs, especially when the AI model wanted to created new sections or provide additional information for minimal READMEs. For example, an original README file mentioned the CMU Computational Biology Hackathon (Mar 3â€“5, 2025) but when ChatGPT created a link for the phrase it led to the University's main home page.

### Key differences between AI models

ChatGPT 4.1 mini (Free tier) loved using emojis while DeepSeek focused more on formatting. Copilot provided a balance of the two, using emojis while also improving the structure of the README files.

### Potential future improvements

- Supplying short README files with repository metadata gathered from GitHub's API, which would provide the AI more context.

- Inputting long README files into smaller sections to avoid truncation and loss of key information.

- Enhancing the prompt to be more general purpose and not specific to a single format.

- Using an AI model's API to allow more control over the input and output.

- Using a more advanced AI model that can handle longer input and output tokens.
