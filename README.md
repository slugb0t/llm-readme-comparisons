# Overview

This repository is a collection of prompts and outputs from various AI models, including DeepSeek, ChatGPT and Copilot, used to try to improve existing README files generated by humans. The goal is to compare the effectiveness of different AI models in enhancing documentation based on GitHub's best practices, open source documentation standards and examples provided in [matiassingers/awesome-readme](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme).

## File Structure

- `prompts/`: Contains the prompt files used to guide the AI models in generating improved README files.
- `[repo]/prompt-[number]/`: Contains the output files from different AI models (e.g., `chatgpt.md`, `deepseek.md`, `copilot.md`) for each prompt number.
- `[repo]/original.md`: Contains the original README file of the repository.
- `repo_meta.py`: Contains a script for extracting metadata from a repository using Octokitpy library.

## Installation

To run the repo_meta.py script, you need to install the Octokitpy library. You can do the following:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install octokitpy
python repo_meta.py
```

## Input

The input is a prompt from the `prompts` directory followed by the raw content of an existing README file.

Note that due to the free tier limitations, long README files may not be fully processed by the AI models causing some sections to be truncated. This is a limitation of the token count in the free tier of the AI models.

## Output

The output is the "improved" README file generated by the AI model.

## Methodology

The prompts were provided to different AI models with new chat interfaces to prevent any influence from previous interactions. The web interface of these models provided a copy button which allowed the output to be copied directly into a markdown file. The outputs were then compared against the original README files to assess improvements.
